	    <h2>How reliable is bank accounting disclosure?</h2>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p>The central question that guided our research in this project
	      was this: How reliable is bank accounting disclosure?	    	   
	    </aside>

	    <h3>Framework</h3>

	    <p class="fragment"> <b>Accounting discretion</b> $\Longrightarrow$
	    <b>ability</b> to misrepresent true performance

	    <p class="fragment"> <b>Incentives</b> to inflate true performance,
	    especially in the state of financial distress.

	    <p class="fragment"> <b>Consequence</b>: "jamming" of the accounting
	    signal. 

	    <p class="fragment"><u>In an extreme case, the accounting signal may lose its ability to
	    discriminate between healthy and unhealthy institutions.</u>

	      <aside class="notes">
		<p> The way we think about this question is the following.

		<p> First, in practice, banks possess substential discretion over their
		  reported accounting performance. As an example of this, one can
		  think of the banks' flexibility in the domains of loan-loss
		  provisioning, and the calculation of asset risk weights, to name a
		  few. The accounting discretion gives banks the ability to
		  misrepresent their true performance. 

		<p> Apart from their capacity to mis-represent performance, a plausible
		  case can be made that under certain conditions, banks also have the 
		  <b>incentives</b> to mis-report their true performance. Specifically, a
		  bank close to distress may use accounting discretion to improve its
		  reported regulatory capital ratio in order to avoid negative
		  attention of its regulator, or to avoid a run on its funding.

		<p> Now, assuming that banks in distress are systematically more likely
		  to use accounting discretion than their healthier peers, one obtains
		  a classical case of so-called signal jamming: namely, that the
		  observed accounting signal loses its ability to discriminate between
		  healthy and unhelathy banks. In the extreme case, in which the
		  reported accounts of the distressed and non-distressed banks are
		  indistinguishable, the information value of the accounting
		  fundamentals in identification of bank distress is essentially
		  non-existent.

	    <h3>Main hypothesis</h3>
	    <br>
	    
	    [Accounting Discretion] $$\propto$$ -[Distress
	    Prediction Performance of Accounting Variables]  

	    <!-- <p><i>The level of banks' <u>accounting discretion</u> -->
	    <!-- is <b>negatively</b> related to the ability of accounting signals to -->
	    <!-- <u>discriminate between distressed and non-distressed banks</u>.</i> -->
	    
	      <aside class="notes">
		<p> This brings me to the main premise, that we want to test in
		  our paper. We expect <i>the level of banks' <u>accounting
		  discretion</u> to be <b>negatively</b> related to the ability
		  of accounting signals to
	    <u>discriminate between distressed and non-distressed banks</u>.</i>
		
		<p> The aim, and indeed, the main contribution of our paper is
		  to document a wide cross-country variation in the
		  classification performance of standardly used accounting
		  fundamentals, and to show that this variation can be largely
		  explained by the proxies of accounting discretion.

	    <br>
	    <ol>

	      <li> Drivers of bank distress.
	      <li> Predictive performance of accounting variables <b>across countries</b>
	      <li> [Accounting Discretion] \(\leftrightarrow\) [Predictability
	      of Bank Distress]
	    </ol>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      Let me give you a brief outline of our empirical approach

	      <p> To set the stage, we construct a comprehensive database of
	      bank distress events in Western Europe and the U.S. during the
	      period 2007-12. We categorize events into two broad groups of bank
	      resolution: (1) bank closures, corresponding to resolutions in
	      which distressed banks cease to exist as independent entities, and
	      (2) open-bank resolutions, in which banks are allowed to continue
	      operating with the assistance of a government bail-out. 

	      <p> We analyze the drivers of bank distress by modelling the two
	      competing groups of distressed bank resolutions in a logistic
	      regression framework. In our benchmark specifications we test
	      for a number of bank-specific variables, including size,
	      regulatory capital, asset quality, liquidity, franchise, or
	      charter value1, and funding costs.

	      <p> Next, we assess the classification performance of accounting
	      fundamentals and of accounting-based models within different
	      countries in our sample. We also test the ability of aggregated
	      accounting measures reported in the fiscal year before the
	      financial crisis to anticipate the aggregate degree of financial
	      distress during the crisis years.

	      <p> In the final part of the paper, we look into the association
	      between information content of accounting fundamentals on one
	      hand, and measures of accounting discretion on the other. We do so
	      by exploiting the cross-country variation in the proxies of
	      national bank disclosure standards and the stringency of their
	      implementation by the national regulators.

	    <h2>Preview of the Main Results</h2>

	      Before going further, let me give you a brief preview of the main
	      results of the paper.

	    <b> Drivers and symptoms of bank distress: </b>
	    <p>

	      <li> asset quality (-)
	      <li> charter value (-)
	      <li> funding costs (+)
	    </ul>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p> First, examination of determinants and/or symptoms of bank
	      distress events reveals that bank distress tends to occur in
	      severely undercapitalized banks with poor asset quality
	      (measured by the reported risk-weighted assets and loan
	      impairments), low charter values (proxied by the net-interest
	      spread), and high funding costs.

	    <h3>Information content of accounting fundamentals</h3>

	    <br>
	    <ol> 
	      <li>  Large cross-country variation in the bank distress
		classification performance.

	      <li> At the country level, accounting fundamentals reported in the
		pre-crisis years of 2006 and 2007, fail to explain the 2007-10
		aggregate incidence of bank distress across countries.
	      </li>
	    </ol>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p> Second, we document a substantial cross-country variation in the
	      bank distress classification performance within the countries
	      included in our sample.

	      <p> We also show that when aggregated at the country level,
	      accounting fundamentals reported in the pre-crisis fiscal years
	      fail to explain the realized aggregate incidence of bank distress
	      during the crisis period of 2007-10.

	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>Better classification performance</b> of accounting
		variables in countries with strong disclosure laws or with more
		stringent enforcement of the existing laws.
	    </ul>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p> In the final part of the paper we test for the association
	      between accounting discretion and the classification performance
	      of accounting fundamentals and show that:

	      <p>first, accounting signals of bank distress tend to be stronger in
		countries with strong disclosure laws or with more stringent
		enforcement of the existing laws.
	      <p>second, accounting discretion/informativeness nexus holds when
		looking at the time series movements in accounting
		fundamentals at the level of distressed banks prior to the
		distress event.
	      <p> Taken as a whole, the evidence in this paper supports the
		often heard belief that excessive flexibility in financial
		reporting undermines the ability of accounting signals to
		accurately capture the underlying financial health of banks.

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p> The subsequent analysis in the paper relies on the
	      comprehensive database of distressed bank resolutions during the
	      2007-12 crisis, that we manually build from a multitude of
	      different sources.

	      <p>Table 1 provides a top-down view of the bank distress
		database. Several interesting observations emerge from the
		table.

	      <p>First, bank distress has been pervasive during the crisis: in
		the countries under study, the assets attributed to banks in
		distress represented on average about 30% of the total
		commercial banking assets4, ranging from 5% in Lux- embourg to
		87% in Greece.

	      <p>Second, banks resolved via closure tend to be smaller on an
		individual as well as on aggregate basis, compared to banks
		resolved via open-bank assis- tance. The average size of a
		closed bank in Europe (the U.S.) is about 39 billion USD (7
		billion USD), whereas the average size of a bank resolved via
		open-bank assistance is 190 billion USD in Europe and 45 billion
		USD in the U.S. In aggregate terms, bank closures represent
		about 15% (30%) of distressed bank assets in Europe
		(respectively, the U.S.).

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p> We begin by analyzing developments in a selection of
		bank accounting measures in the periods leading up to the a
		distress event.

	      <p> We do so by estimating the following specification [show on
		slide], where f are dummies denoting each year to distress (0
		indicating the time of event) and $\alpha_{ct}$ denotes the
		country-year specific effects. We estimate the specification for
		each selected accounting ratio individually, and plot the
		resulting $\phi$ coefficients together with their corresponding
		standard errors.
		
	      <p>Each of the accounting variables is standardized to have a zero
		mean and variance of one, implying the following interpretation of
		a coefficient $\phi_j$ : banks experiencing distress event between j and
		j + 1 years in the future display on average $\phi_j$ standard deviations
		higher or lower value of y than their non-distressed peers,
		controlling for country-year specific trends.

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p>The most important result relates to bank capitalization:
		distressed banks in both Europe and the U.S. tend to be
		significantly under-capitalized with respect to their
		non-distressed peers.

	      <p>The economic magnitude of the result is especially big for
		bank closures, with the distressed/non-distressed Tier 1 capital
		lag reaching 0.4 standard deviations in a year before the
		distress event. 

	      <p>In Europe, the relative Tier 1 under-capitalization of
		distressed banks spans the period of at least 5 years before the
		distress event, while in the U.S. the under-performance is
		particularly notable during the three years before the
		event. Finally, U.S. distressed banks undergoing an open-bank
		resolutions are on aver- age significantly better capitalized
		than their European counterparts in the same distress group.


	      <p>Decline in Tier 1 capitalization of distressed banks coincides
		with deterioration in their profitability, particularly for the
		group of banks that are eventually closed. Deterioration in
		profitability, in turn, is related to increasing loan-loss
		provisions and impairment charges, as well as to declining
		interest margins and operating efficiency (measured by the
		fraction of non-interest expenses in bank gross revenues). 

	      <p> Finally, a comparison of pre-event trends in accounting
		fundamentals between banks in Europe and the U.S. reveals a
		strong deterioration in fundamentals for bank closures in the
		U.S., whereas no such clear time-pattern is present in Europe. A
		temporal deterioration in fundamentals of the closed banks in
		the U.S. is particularly pronounced in the case of Tier 1
		capital, unreserved impaired loans, loan loss provisions,
		non-interest expenses, and profitability.

	      an exponential hazard model, in which a probability of distress
	      does not depend on the banks' age.

	      <p> Also as before, all explanatory variables are standardized to
	      have a mean zero and a unit variance, so that the magnitude of the
	      reported coefficient corresponds to the impact of one standard
	      deviation increase in the explanatory variable on the log-odds
	      ratio. Consequently, the absolute magnitude of the coefficient can
	      be used to judge the relative economic importance of different
	      variables in the specification.

	      <p> As you can see in the table, the likelihood of bank closure
		increases with (1) the degree of Tier 1 undercapitalization, (2)
		asset risk (measured by the ratio of RWA to book assets), (3)
		the amount of unreserved loan loss impairments, (4) cost of
		funding, and (5) the degree of operational inefficiency, (6) a
		decrease in bank profitability, measured by the interest margin,
		and (7) a decrease in asset liquidity, though the effect of the
		latter is statistically insignificant.

	      <p> In terms of its explanatory power, the bank closure model
		explains bank closures with substantially higher degree of
		accuracy in the U.S. (with pseudo R-squared of 40%) than in
		Europe (13%). In the light of the univariate dynamics reported
		in Figure 1 this is not surprising, because most accounting
		ratios reported by the distressed banks in the U.S. exhibit
		clear negative trends already several years prior to the
		distress event. If we change the forecasting horizon in the
		U.S. to two years in the future, the R-squared of the model
		drops to around 20%.

	      <p>In this exercise, we evaluate the informativeness of the
		multivariate bank failure models developed before in
		discriminating between distressed and non-distressed banks within
		each country in our sample.

	      <p>The informativeness of a model is measured by the area under
		the ROC curve12 (henceforth AUC) from a classification exercise
		in which the model-implied predictions are used to predict bank
		distress within a specific country. A particularly useful
		interpretation of the AUC is that it is the probability that the
		randomly chosen distressed bank observations exhibit higher
		values of the predicted model score than the randomly chosen
		surviving observation. At one end of the spectrum, a completely
		uninformative classifier has the AUC of 0.5, whereas a perfectly
		predictive classifier has an ROC of 1.

	      <p> We assess the within-country predictive performance of
		different model predictions, by computing AUCs for each
		individual country. AUCs are obtained from the non-parametric
		ROC estimation, using bootstrap.

		Countries and the U.S. in the period 2006-2012.

	      <p> Each column in the table corresponds to the model that is used
		to generate bank distress predictions. Each model is a logistic
		regression using the same vector of covariates as the
		multivariate models discussed before. The models differ in the
		sample used to estimate the model (i.e Europe, U.S., or both)
		and in the event that serves as the dependent variable in the

	      <p> For the sake of brevity, I show only the excerpt from the
	      table.

	      <p> The main conclusions that emerge from the exercise, and are
	      important for our subsequent analysis, are the following:

	      <p> Predictions generated by any given model display substantial
	      cross-country variation in the accuracy of the within-country
	      forecasts of any of the three types of bank distress events.

	      <p> Some of the countries with consistently low accuracy of
	      distress predictions include Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, and
	      Denmark. In these countries, the accuracy of predictions in
	      general does not exceed the AUC of 70%, and is, in many cases,
	      close to the uninformative benchmark of 50%

	      <p> Countries with consistently high levels of accuracy include
	      the U.S., Austria, France, and Germany. The accuracy of
	      predictions in these countries is typically above AUC of 80%.

	      <p>In order to examine the sources of poor predictive performance

		it is instructive to examine the informativeness of the
		individual accounting fundamentals that comprise the bank

		section.

	      <p> For each of the 10 accounting fundamentals used in the models
		in Table 4 we proceed by computing the country-specific AUC from
		using the ratio in the prediction of generally- defined distress
		events (either closure or the open-bank resolution) within 1
		year in the future. In Figure 2 we plot the resulting AUCs,
		together with the 95% confidence intervals, for each country and

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p>Another way to asses the information content of accounting
		variables is to examine an alternative way to measure the

	      <p> Having defined the benchmark measure of country-wide bank

	      <p> Several observations emerge from the figure. 

	      <p>First, reported Tier 1 and Tier 2 regulatory capital ratios
		(reported as a fraction of risk-weighted assets) serve as poor

		anything, banks in countries with high rates of distress in
		2008-10 report on average higher levels of both forms of
		regulatory capital in years preceding the crisis. 
		
	      <p> Apart from the reported asset risk weights, the only bank
		accounting-based aggregate in 2006 that exhibits a clear
		relation with the ex-post bank distress in 2008-10 is the
		net-interest margin. Specifically, countries with banks that
		reported on average higher net-interest margins in 2006 experi-
		enced higher incidence of bank distress during 2008-10.

	      <p> Measure the information of content of an accounting fundamental,
		$x$, as the absolute magnitude of the marginal impact of $x$ on
		the probability that a bank becomes distressed 1 year in the
		future, within a cross section of banks in country $c$ at time
		$t$:

		$$  INFO_{ct}(x) =\Bigg|\Bigg| \left. \frac{\partial
		Pr(\text{Distressed}_{ict} = 1)}{\partial x_{ict}}
		\right|_{\text{c,t fixed}} \Bigg|\Bigg|$$

	      <p> The hypothesis can be restated as:
		$$$$
		$$INFO_{ct}(x)\Bigg|_{\substack{\\c\in\text{Good Disclosure
		Country}}} > INFO_{ct}(x)\Bigg|_{\substack{\\c\in\text{Bad
		Disclosure Country}}} \geq 0$$
	    </small>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p> The intuition of the measure is simple: the information value
		of an accounting fundamental increases with its ability to
		identify distress in a cross section of banks in a given
		country-year. In line with the discussion above we expect the
		informativeness of an accounting measure to be greater in
		countries with more stringent standards or with more vigilant
		implementation of the standards by the regulators. Following the
		previous notation, this can be stated as: [show equation].

	      <p> Notice that the hypothesis does not postulate the direction of
		the correlation between the accounting signal and bank distress,
		but concerns only the magnitude of the correspondence. The
		implications of the hypothesis can be nuanced further, by taking
		into account the direction of the associations between bank
		distress and fundamentals, predicted by the banking
		theory. Theoretically, one expects to observe a negative asso-
		ciation between bank distress and bank capital (both Tier 1 and
		Tier 2), and a positive association between bank distress and
		RWA, unreserved impaired loans, and loan loss provisions. We
		expect the theoretically predicted direction of the
		correspondence to be stronger in countries with better
		disclosure laws, which implies a negative interaction term, for
		bank capital, and a positive interaction term for RWA,
		unreserved impaired loans, and loan loss provisions.

	      <p> This table presents the results of the tests. 

	      <p> We separately estimate the specification for five accounting
		ratios that are often considered as the most prone to
		manipulation, namely: (1) Tier 1 capital ratio, (2) Tier 2
		capital ratio, (3) risk-weighted assets20, (4) unreserved loan
		losses, and (5) loan loss provisions. Columns 1-7 report the
		estimates for the regressions with regulatory interactions for
		each of the disclosure and monitoring indices described before.

	      <p> Estimates reported in different panels come from separate
		univariate estimations of the specification. Since our
		regulatory variables are standardized to lie in the range
		between 0 (worst disclosure quality) and 1 (best disclosures
		quality), the interpretation of the interaction term coefficient
		is straight- forward: it represents a change in the marginal
		contribution of the accounting fundamental on the probability of
		bank distress as one moves from the worst-disclosure
		jurisdiction to the best-disclosure jurisdiction.

	      <p> Results are consistent with the disclosure-quality hypothesis
		for Tier 1 regulatory capi- tal ratio, unreserved loan losses
		and loan loss provisions. In each of the cases, an accounting
		signal of bank distress tends to be stronger in countries with
		strong disclosure laws and/or with more stringent enforcement of
		the existing laws. Additionally, the direction of the accounting
		signal in each of the three cases is consistent with the
		theoretical prior. Specifi- cally, Tier 1 regulatory capital
		ratio exhibits a negative relation with bank distress, whereas
		the unreserved loan losses and the loan loss provisions exhibit
		a positive association.

		disclosure-contingent reversion in the association between bank
		distress and Tier 2 capital is even more pronounced within a

	    <p>One may argue that obliqueness of the distressed banks' accounting
