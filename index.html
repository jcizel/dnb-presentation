	  <section> 
	    <ul>
	      <li>  <b> Drivers of bank distress: </b>
		<ul> 
		  <li> closures and open-bank resolutions tend to occur in
		    severely undercapitalized banks with poor asset quality
		    (measured by the reported risk-weighted assets and loan
		    impairments), low charter values (proxied by the net-interest
		    spread), and high funding costs.
		</ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>
	  <section> 
	    <ul>
	      <li> 
		<b>Information content of accounting fundamentals</b>
		<ul> 
		  <li>  accounting-based model predictions display
		    a substantial cross-country variation in the bank distress
		    classification performance 
		  </li>
		  <li> accounting fundamentals, aggregated at the country level
		    during the pre-crisis years of 2006 and 2007, fail to explain
		    the 2007-10 aggregate incidence of bank distress across
		    countries.
		  </li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>
	  <section> 
	    <ul>
	      <li>  <b> Nexus b/w information content of bank accounting and
		  national bank disclosure standards (and their enforcement by regulators)</b>
		<ul>
		  <li> Accounting signals of bank distress tend to be stronger
		    in countries with strong disclosure laws or with more
		    stringent enforcement of the existing laws.
		  <li> Disclosure-quality/informativeness nexus holds when
		    looking at the time series movements in accounting
		    fundamentals at the level of distressed banks prior to the
		    distress event.
		</ul>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>

	  <section>
	    <h2>Summary</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li> The evidence in this paper supports the oft-voiced belief
		that excessive flexibility in financial reporting undermines the
		ability of accounting signals to accurately capture the underlying
		financial health of banks. 
	      <li> Obliqueness of the distressed banks' accounting signals makes
		such information less useful for investors and regulators. 
	      <li> The information content of accounting fundamentals, at least
		with respect to the identification of distressed banks, might be
		improved by increased stringency of bank disclosure laws and their
		enforcement.

	    <h2>Regulatory Disclosure Environment and the Informativeness of Bank
	      Accounting Signals </h2>
	  </section>

	  <section>
	    <p> Predictability of bank distress by accounting fundamentals
	      varies substantially across countries.

	    <p> Bank management has capacity and incentives to exercise
	    accounting discretion in order to report inaccurate information.

	    <!-- <p> To the extent that banks in financial distress are more likely -->
	    <!-- to use accounting discretion to improve their reported performance -->
	    <!-- relative to their healthier peers, the ability of the accounting -->
	    <!-- numbers to discriminate between distressed and non-distressed banks -->
	    <!-- is necessarily reduced. -->

	    <p>  Bank disclosure standards and their enforcement by regulators
	    provide a constraint on  accounting discretion and on their
	    information revelation incentives.

	    <p> <b>To what extent do differences in bank disclosure standards
	      and their enforcement by regulators explain differences in
	      accounting informativeness?</b>

	    <h3>Measurement of Bank Disclosure Standards and Their Enforcement
	    by the Regulators</h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li> Obtain a set of proxy measures of country-specific bank
		disclosure quality from the database of Barth, Caprio, and
		Levine (2013).
		<small><ul>
		  <li> more than 50 different indices from the
		  quadrennial World Bank surveys covering 180 countries since
		  1999.
		</ul></small>
	      <!-- <li> Each regulatory index is standardized according to the -->
	      <!-- 	following formula: $$R^*_c = \frac{R_c - min(R)} {max(R) - -->
	      <!-- 	min(R)}\in[0,1],$$. -->
	      <li> For each index, higher values of the index correspond to
	      either better disclosure standards, or a more stringent
	      implementation of the standards by the regulator.

	      Content in a Cross-Section of Banks</h2>
	    <medium>
	      <ul>
		<li> <b>Hypothesis</b>: Given a cross section of banks in
		  country $c$ at time $t$, the marginal impact of an accounting
		  fundamental, $x$, on the probability of bank distress,
		  increases with the value of the regulatory disclosure index, $R$.
		<!-- <li> <b>Intuition</b>: the information value of an accounting -->
		<!--   fundamental increases with its ability to identify distress in -->
		<!--   a cross section of banks in a given country-year -->
		<!-- <li> $$  Pr(\text{Distressed}_{ict} = 1) = \text{Logit}(\alpha_{ct} + x_{ict}'\theta -->

		<!--   \epsilon_{ict})\\ -->
		<!--   =\text{Logit}(\alpha_{ct} + x_{ict}*(\phi_1 + \phi_2 R_{ct}) +   \epsilon_{ict})\\ -->
		<!--   = \text{Logit}(\alpha_{ct} + \phi_1*x_{ict} + \phi_2*R_{ct}*x_{ict} +  -->
		<!--   \epsilon_{ict})$$ -->
		<li> The hypothesis postulates that the absolute marginal
		  contribution of an accounting ratio is stronger in countries
		  with stringent bank disclosure environment
		  <!-- , hence $|\phi_1 + -->
